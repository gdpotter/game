HTML5 Sidescrolling Game
====

The beginnings of a side-scrolling game written entirely from sratching using HTML5 canvas
and JavaScript. Terrain is randomly generated using a series of noise generators to create
interesting landscapes. This project (unfortunately) has been somewhat abandoned, although
I do intend to continue working on it sometime in the future.

To try it out:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
and then open ```client/index.htm```
